        <h1>Tips for Financial Cybersecurity</h1>

        <h2>1. Fortify Your Login Defenses</h2>
        <p>The first line of defense against financial cybercrime is securing your point of entry. It is no longer sufficient to rely solely on a password. You must enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on every single bank and investment account. MFA adds a critical layer of security by requiring a second form of verification—such as a fingerprint scan, facial recognition, or a temporary code sent to an authenticator app—before access is granted. This ensures that even if a hacker manages to steal your password, they still cannot access your funds without your physical device. Additionally, avoid the common mistake of reusing passwords. Use a reputable password manager to generate and store complex, unique passwords (20+ characters) for each institution.</p>

        <h2>2. Be Vigilant Against Phishing</h2>
        <p>Social engineering remains the most common method criminals use to steal financial data. Hackers frequently send "phishing" emails or text messages that appear to come from legitimate banks, often using urgent language like "Account Suspended" or "Unauthorized Login Attempt" to panic you into acting quickly. To protect yourself, adopt a "Zero Trust" policy with links. Never click on a link provided in an unsolicited message. Instead, navigate directly to your bank’s official website by typing the URL into your browser or using their official mobile app. Always verify the sender's email address and look for subtle spelling errors in the website URL (typosquatting) before entering any credentials.</p>

        <h2>3. Secure Your Digital Environment</h2>
        <p>Your financial data is only as secure as the device accessing it. Avoid checking your bank balance or making transfers while connected to public Wi-Fi networks at cafes, airports, or hotels, as these open networks allow attackers to intercept the data being transmitted. If you must bank on the go, disconnect from Wi-Fi and use your cellular data, or utilize a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to encrypt your connection. Furthermore, ensure that your computer and smartphone operating systems are set to update automatically. Financial malware often exploits security holes in outdated software, so keeping your devices patched is an essential preventative measure.</p>

        <h2>4. Monitor Your Financial Footprint</h2>
        <p>Even with the best defenses, vigilance is key. Do not wait for your monthly statement to arrive to check for fraud. Most modern banking applications allow you to configure real-time push notifications for every transaction. Enabling this feature allows you to spot fraudulent activity the moment it happens. Be on the lookout for small "test charges" (often under $5), which thieves use to verify a card works before making a large purchase. If you see any unauthorized activity, or if you are not using a specific credit card regularly, use your bank's app to "freeze" the card instantly.</p>

# 💼 Job Simulations & Virtual Experience Portfolio

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success) ![Focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Practical%20Experience-blue)

Welcome to my **Job Simulations** repository! 🚀

This repository serves as a portfolio of the practical work I have completed during various **Virtual Job Simulations** and **Virtual Experience Programs** (via platforms like **The Forage**).

These simulations allow me to step into the shoes of a full-time employee at top-tier companies, tackling real-world scenarios that mimic the actual day-to-day tasks of roles in **Software Engineering** and **Project Management**.

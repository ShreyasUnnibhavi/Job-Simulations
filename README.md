# 💼 Job Simulations & Virtual Experience Portfolio

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Active-success) ![Focus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Practical%20Experience-blue)

Welcome to my **Job Simulations** repository! 🚀

This repository serves as a portfolio of the practical work I have completed during various **Virtual Job Simulations** and **Virtual Experience Programs** (via platforms like **The Forage**). 

These simulations allow me to step into the shoes of a full-time employee at top-tier companies, tackling real-world scenarios that mimic the actual day-to-day tasks of roles in **Software Engineering** and **Project Management**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each folder in this repository represents a distinct company simulation. Inside, you will find:
- **Task Submissions:** Practical deliverables such as spreadsheets, project plans, and feature proposals.
- **Source Code:** Technical implementations including HTML/CSS, UML diagrams, and code refactoring.
- **Certificates:** Completion certificates verifying the work done.

### 🔹 Key Competencies Demonstrated
Across these projects, I have applied skills in:
* **Software Engineering:** Designing system architectures (UML) and implementing web features.
* **Project Management:** Defining project scope, identifying KPIs, and managing stakeholder communication.
* **Data Analysis:** Structuring data and creating actionable insights using Excel.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

I utilize the specific tech stack required for each simulation to mimic real-world constraints. My work typically involves:

* **Object-Oriented Languages:** (e.g., Java, C++, Python) used for core application logic.
* **Web Technologies:** HTML/CSS/JS for frontend components.
* **Data & Scripting:** SQL, Excel, and Shell scripting for data analysis and automation.
* **Documentation:** UML Class Diagrams and technical reports.
